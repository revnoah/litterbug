# Litterbug
In Litterbug, you play the role of a trash collector in a bustling city. Your task is to clean up the streets and keep the city clean. However, you must be quick because litterbugs are also on the prowl, looking for trash to scavenge. The more trash you collect, the more litterbugs will appear, so you must act fast to keep up with the increasing demand.

As you progress through the levels, the game becomes increasingly challenging, with more litterbugs to compete with and tougher obstacles to navigate. But with quick reflexes and a bit of strategy, you can become the ultimate trash-collecting hero and save the city from litterbugs!

## Requirements
Litterbug requires a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. It is built using the Phaser 3 game engine, which is included in the project.

## Gameplay
To play Litterbug, use the arrow keys to move your trash collector around the city streets. The objective is to collect as much trash as possible while avoiding obstacles and competing with litterbugs.

The game is divided into levels, each with a different target score that you must reach to progress to the next level. To complete a level, collect enough trash to reach the target score before the time runs out.

Be careful not to collide with obstacles or get caught by litterbugs, or you will lose valuable time and points. As you progress through the levels, the game becomes increasingly challenging, with more litterbugs to compete with and tougher obstacles to navigate.
